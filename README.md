SDL stands for *S*chema *D*efinition *L*anguage. It's a language for describing models in a system.

Alone, it doesn't do a whole lot. However, you might find helpful for building [code generators](https://github.com/rzane/geny).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sdl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sdl

## Examples

### Define a schema

```ruby
SDL.define do
  model :user do
    attribute :email, :string, unique: true
    has_many :posts
    timestamps
  end

  model :post do
    attribute :title, :string, limit: 120
    attribute :body, :text, nullable: true
    enum :status, values: [:draft, :published], default: :draft
    belongs_to :user, foreign_key: true
    has_one_attached :image
    timestamps
  end
end
```

### Load a schema from a file

```ruby
# schema.rb
model :user do
  attribute :name, :string
end
```

```ruby
SDL.load_file "schema.rb"
```

### Parse command-line arguments

```ruby
SDL.parse "user", %w[
  email:unique
  posts:has_many
]

SDL.parse "post", %w[
  title:string{120}
  body:text:nullable
  status:enum{draft,published}
  user:belongs_to:foreign_key
  image:has_one_attached
]
```
